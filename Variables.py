#python don't have any library to generate variables. Variables automatically created when we assign new values in it.

#Examples 1: string type examples
Fruits = "orange","Papaya","pineapple","grapes"   #here we define fruits as a varibles where I assign fruits name in it.

#even you can assign diffrent types of values like numbers, boolean value, float type values, string, list,tuple etc

number = 3,7,8,4,6,9

#Rules of Define Variables:-
'''
1. variables should be start with alphabet and underscore 
2. we cann't start varibles with numbers and special charactors like [$<%<#<@<!<?]

Variables Name Examples:
1. data1
2. _data1
3. data_set
4. _data_set
5. _dataset_
etc

There are 3 ways to make Variables more atractive:-
1. Camel case:-


2. Pascal case:-


3. snake case:-
